Retail Sales Analysis Report
=============================

Objective:
----------
To analyze retail sales data using Apache Spark for actionable insights related to:
- Inventory Management
- Marketing Strategy Optimization
- Customer Satisfaction

Dataset:
--------
The dataset includes the following attributes:
- TransactionID, Date, CustomerID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, Total Amount, StoreID

1. Data Ingestion & Cleaning:
-----------------------------
- Loaded CSV into Spark using `spark.read.csv()`.
- Handled missing values using `dropna()`.
- Removed duplicate records using `dropDuplicates()`.
- Parsed the `Date` column into proper date format.

2. Data Transformation (Using Spark SQL/DataFrame API):
--------------------------------------------------------
- Aggregated sales per Product Category, Store, and Customer.
- Extracted Month and Year from the Date column for time-based analysis.

3. Analysis & Insights:
-----------------------
a) Top-Selling Products:
   - Product categories with the highest revenue identified.
   - Useful for inventory focus and promotions.

b) Top-Performing Stores:

   - Helps in identifying seasonal peaks.

4. Visualizations:
------------------
- A line chart was generated showing monthly sales trends.
- Saved as: `monthly_sales_trend.png`

5. Optimization Techniques:
---------------------------
- Used `.cache()` for reused datasets.
- Used `.repartition("StoreID")` for performance tuning.
- Mentioned best practices like broadcast joins for small tables.

Recommendations:
----------------
- Stock up on top-selling product categories before peak months.
- Reward and retain high-value customers.
- Invest more in top-performing stores and replicate their strategies.
